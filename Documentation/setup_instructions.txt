Need latest version of python installed (ideally installed on PATH)

Run:

pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material

In the Documentation folder, run `mkdocs serve` to get an auto-refreshing development test version while editing
When done, in the same folder, run `mkdocs build` to render everything 

The .meta.yml file sets tags/metadata for every file in its directory (and subdirectories).
