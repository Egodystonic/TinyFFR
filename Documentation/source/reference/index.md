	Full reference documentation is planned for v1.0 of TinyFFR. Only a very small handful of types are documented in this section thus far. Use the index on the left to view current documentation where it does exist.

	In the meantime please feel free to ask questions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Egodystonic/TinyFFR/discussions).
