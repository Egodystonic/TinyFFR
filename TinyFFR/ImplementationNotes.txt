Parameter Checking / Validation:
	General philosophy is to parameter validate/check only where the branching + checking will not dwarf the runtime cost of the method.
	A starting rule-of-thumb is that if the method is inlinable we should consider skipping parameter validation.
		However, this isn't always the case-- for example if the actual function body still invokes something costly or if the function is not expected to be called often, it's probably still worth validating.
	Overall, the idea is that by validating wherever possible we can hopefully balance helping users catch mistakes without sacrificing performance.
