To compile the .txt files to .filamat files, use matc.exe (downloaded as part of the compressed filament download).

Commandline should look as follows:

matc.exe -p desktop -a opengl -o Path\To\TinyFFR\Assets\Materials\Local\Shaders\shader_name.filamat Path\To\TinyFFR\Assets\Materials\Local\Shaders\shader_name.txt

Don't include matc.exe in the repo as I'm not sure about redistribution rights and we also don't want to mix matc versions up if/when we upgrade the filament version.
