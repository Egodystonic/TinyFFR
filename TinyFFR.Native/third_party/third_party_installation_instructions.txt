Can't add binaries to repo because files are too big. Here's instructions on how to get this compiling:

	Add following folder structure to this dir (third_party):
		binaries/
			assimp/
				debug/
				release/
			filament/
				debug/
				release/
			sdl/

	Download Filament 1.60.0 https://github.com/google/filament/releases/tag/v1.60.0 (windows build for now)
		Copy the libs from /lib/x86_64/mt/ to binaries/filament/release/
		Copy the libs from /lib/x86_64/mtd/ to binaries/filament/debug/
		Copy the headers from /include/ to headers/filament/
	
	Download Assimp 5.3.1 https://github.com/assimp/assimp/releases/tag/v5.3.1 (source code)
		Extract the downloaded source somewhere (not in the TinyFFR repo, we'll copy the resultant libs after)
		Make sure cmake is installed (https://cmake.org/download/)
		After extraction, open a command prompt in the root directory of the extracted zip:
			cmake CMakeLists.txt -DASSIMP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DASSIMP_BUILD_ASSIMP_VIEW=OFF
			cmake --build .
			cmake --build . --config Release
		This will have created the libraries inside the extracted source folder:
		Copy from bin/Debug and lib/Debug in the extracted folder to binaries/assimp/debug/
		Copy from bin/Release and lib/Release in the extracted folder to binaries/assimp/release/
	
	Download SDL 2.28.5 https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5 (get the devel VC zip)
		Copy SDL2.lib and SDL2.dll from /lib/x64/ to binaries/sdl/
